# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-08-28)

**Core value:** Jon can trust Keepling as his daily task system on Mac and iPhone: capture is immediate, accepted changes are never silently lost or overwritten, and both human and agent actions remain inspectable and recoverable.  
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — One Trustworthy Task

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6  
Plan: Not yet planned  
Status: Ready for phase discussion  
Progress: ░░░░░░░░░░ 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Keepling is the confirmed working product and repository name; formal trademark/namespace clearance remains open.
- One coordinating monorepo owns planning, apps, shared contracts/tokens, infrastructure, and release evidence.
- Framework directories are documented now but scaffolded only when their vertical phase starts.
- Phoenix/PostgreSQL is canonical; React is shared by browser/Electron; iPhone remains native SwiftUI.
- Offline correctness comes from local durable projection/outbox plus idempotent server reconciliation, not background scheduling or WebSockets.
- The first milestone is personal dogfood, not commercial launch.
- GSD uses coarse phases, parallel execution, committed planning docs, research/plan-check/verifier quality gates, and no automatic continuation into Phase 1.

### Retained Research

- Navigation index: `.planning/knowledge/INDEX.md`
- Normalized project research: `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md`
- Brand seed: `docs/brand/BRAND-SEED.md`
- Repository boundaries: `docs/architecture/REPOSITORY.md`

### Open Decisions for Phase Discussion

- Exact v1 temporal model and minimum Things-parity loop.
- Initial iOS version floor and local persistence adapter.
- Authentication and device/session fencing.
- Electron SQLite implementation and migration fixture strategy.
- License and contributor governance.
- Backup RPO/RTO and whether PITR is required before sustained dogfood.
- Canonical domain and namespace acquisition; formal Keepling clearance.

## Next Action

Run `$gsd-discuss-phase 1` from the repository root.
